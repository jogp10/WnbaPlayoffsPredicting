    "So with that we end our understanding phase.\n",
    "Our main takeaways are:\n",
    "- There are dead players in the players table. We should take that into account when doing the analysis.\n",
    "- There are players that have not played any season of the seasons given. We should take that into account when doing the analysis. There are 338 players that have not played any season.\n",
    "- There are no Null entries (although there values that are simply an empty string)\n",
    "- There are some columns with the DataType \"object\", most of them being strings.\n",
    "- There are binary objects (like confID and playoff, in the 'teams' table, with the values \"Y\" or \"N\") that could be substituted by a binary, as well as ternary objects (like the firstRound, semis and finals in the 'teams' table, with the values \"W\", \"L\" or \"\") that could also be transformed.\n",
    "- There are players with no position and no college assigned (\"\").\n",
    "- There are players with no date of birth in the record (0000-00-00).\n",
    "- There is the need to do null value uniformization, as there are some columns with empty strings, others with default 0 values and other values that represent null.\n",
    "- The height and weight variables have default 0 values and should be treated as null values.\n",
    "- The number of games played by each team differs (there may be teams that are no longer playing), so we can't compare the number of wins and losses directly. Win percentage should be used.\n",
    "- In terms of win percentage, it seems like a competitive league, with more than half of the teams having a win percentage of 50% or more, taking advantage of the worst teams. There is also just one team below 40% of wins.\n",
    "- There are teams that are no longer playing.\n",
    "- There are a lot of highly correlated variables."
